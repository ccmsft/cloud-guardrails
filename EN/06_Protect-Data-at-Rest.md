# Protection of Data-at-Rest

## Objective

Protect data at rest by default (e.g. storage) for cloud-based workloads.

## Key Considerations

* [ ] Seek guidance from privacy and access to information officials within institutions before storing personal information in cloud-based environments.
* [ ] Implement an encryption mechanism to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data when data are at rest in your solution&#39;s storage.
* [ ] Use CSE-approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols, in accordance with [ITSP.40.111](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cryptographic-algorithms-unclassified-protected-and-protected-b-information-itsp40111) and [ITSP.40.062](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-securely-configuring-network-protocols-itsp40062).
* [ ] Implement key management procedures.

## Validation

* [ ] Confirm policy for encryption (e.g. storage and/or VM based on risk-based assessment).

## Applicable Service Models

* IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
